    House MD is a popular American medical drama television series that aired on Fox from 2004 to 2012. It follows the story of the brilliant but unconventional diagnostician, Dr. Gregory House, played by Hugh Laurie, who leads a team of physicians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

The show's central character, Dr. House, is known for his sarcastic wit, acerbic personality, and unorthodox methods of treating patients. He often clashes with his colleagues and superiors, including his best friend Dr. James Wilson, played by Robert Sean Leonard, and hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy, played by Lisa Edelstein.

Each episode of House MD typically centers around a difficult medical case that the team must solve. Dr. House and his team use their expertise, intuition, and unconventional methods to diagnose and treat the patient's ailments, often leading to unexpected twists and turns in the plot.

Throughout the series, Dr. House also struggles with chronic pain and addiction to pain medication, which adds a layer of complexity to his character and relationships with others.

House MD was highly praised for its writing, acting, and portrayal of medical cases, and it remains a popular and influential show in the medical drama genre.
